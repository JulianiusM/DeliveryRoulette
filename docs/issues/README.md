# Issue bodies and creation scripts

This folder contains one Markdown file per issue.
Use the scripts in the repository root to create labels, milestones, and issues via GitHub CLI.

Recommended flow:
1) Copy docs/ to your repository.
2) Run ./create_issues.sh

Requirements:
- gh CLI installed
- gh auth login completed
- Run from the repository root (the directory that contains docs/issues)
